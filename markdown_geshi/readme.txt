Markdown Extra GeSHi
====================

Version 1.0 - 2009-05-08

by Anthony Bush

Installation
------------

The `markdown_geshi` module is meant to be easy to use.  Anywhere you normally would have included the `markdown.php` file from Markdown or Markdown Extra you can instead include `markdown_geshi.php`.

`template.php` does not have to be used and is just a cache-out of TextMate's "bright" theme.
